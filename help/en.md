#Usage Guide

##Save a page

Uhuru Wiki automatically saves your changes if you:

- are inactive for 2 seconds
- move the focus out of a editable area
- upload an asset
- drop a media link to the content area

##Edit a page

- click on the area you want to edit
- make your changes
- either wait 2 seconds or click anywhere outside the editable area and the page is saved

##Delete a page

Deleting a page does not really delete a page but marks it as deleted. To restore a deleted page select _restore_ from the tasks menu. After 30 days deleted pages are wiped from the system and can not be restored again. This period is configurable.

##Upload Attachments

Drag files from your computer to the drop zone marked with _drop files here_

- __image file__ from your computer into the content area where you want the images to appear
